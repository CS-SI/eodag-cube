    has a `location` attribute that initially points to its remote location, but is
    later changed to point to its path on the filesystem when the product has been
    downloaded. It also has a `remote_location` that always points to the remote
    location, so that the product can be downloaded at anytime if it is deleted from
    the filesystem. An EOProduct instance also has a reference to the search
    parameters that led to its creation.
